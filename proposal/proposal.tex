\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Project Topic}
Our project aims to simulate the collision of different types of objects and render the simulation
outcome with an industrial renderer.

\subsection{Project Goals and Technical Points}
Our primary goal includes implementing different types of object simulations: rigid body, cloth, fluid and their collision. We also aim to build a rendering pipeline to visualize the simulation results with high quality. Apart from basic implementation, we plan to optimize the simulation performance, provide user-friendly configuration options and support real-time interaction.

The technical points of our project include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Implementing rigid body dynamics with collision detection and response.
\item Implementing fluid simulation using the Lagrangian point-based WCSPH method \cite{10.5555/1272690.1272719}.
\item Implementing fluid and rigid body collision handling with a momentum-conserving two-way coupling method \cite{10.1145/2185520.2185558}.
\item Building a rendering pipeline using Blender to visualize simulation results.
\item Optimizing simulation performance through algorithmic improvements and multi-threading.
\item Providing flexible configuration options for different simulation scenarios.
\item Supporting real-time interaction for customized scene setup.
\end{itemize}

\section{Methods Completed}
\subsection{Rigid Body}
\subsection{Collision Handling}
\subsection{Fluid}
We have implemented a basic WCSPH fluid simulator using the Taichi programming language. The simulator supports essential SPH operations such as density and pressure computation, viscosity and surface tension forces, and time integration. We have also integrated the SplashSurf library to reconstruct fluid surfaces from particle data for rendering.

The WCSPH method approximates fluid dynamics using a set of particles, where each particle represents a small volume of fluid. The core equations include:

Density computation for particle $i$:
\[
\rho_i = \sum_j m_j W(r_{ij}, h)
\]
where $m_j$ is the mass of particle $j$, $W$ is the cubic smoothing kernel with support radius $h$, and $r_{ij} = |\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|$.

Pressure calculation using the Tait equation:
\[
p_i = B \left( \left( \frac{\rho_i}{\rho_0} \right)^\gamma - 1 \right)
\]
where $\rho_0$ is the rest density, $B$ is the bulk modulus, and $\gamma = 7$ for water.

The pressure force on particle $i$:
\[
\mathbf{f}_i^{pressure} = -\sum_j m_j \left( \frac{p_i}{\rho_i^2} + \frac{p_j}{\rho_j^2} \right) \nabla W(r_{ij}, h)
\]

Viscosity force (Morris model):
\[
\mathbf{f}_i^{viscosity} = \nu \sum_j m_j \frac{(\mathbf{v}_i - \mathbf{v}_j) \cdot \mathbf{r}_{ij}}{r_{ij}^2 + 0.01 h^2} \nabla W(r_{ij}, h)
\]
where $\nu$ is the viscous term.

Surface tension force (approximated):
\[
\mathbf{f}_i^{surface} = - \frac{\kappa}{\rho_i} \sum_j \rho_j W(r_{ij}, h) \mathbf{r}_{ij}
\]
where $\kappa$ is the surface tension coefficient.

Time integration uses a semi-implicit Euler method to update positions and velocities. 

To efficiently find neighboring particles, we employ a uniform grid data structure. Each particle is assigned to a grid cell based on its position, and only particles in the same or adjacent cells are considered as potential neighbors, reducing the computational complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$.

\subsection{Rendering Pipeline}
We have successfully implemented the core pipeline components. The rendering pipeline features adjustable rendering with Principled BSDF materials for water effects, EEVEE engine with screen space reflections, and PNG output. Video creation uses ffmpeg to encode PNG sequences into MP4 videos with configurable settings.

\section{Plan for Remaining Technical Tasks}
The remaining tasks focus on refinement and optimization. 

First, we plan tto read more advanced papers on fluid simulation and collision handling to explore potential improvements of the basic WCSPH method. We will also investigate parallelization techniques to enhance simulation performance.

Second, we will implement the fluid-rigid body collision handling using a momentum-conserving two-way coupling method. This involves calculating interaction forces between fluid particles and rigid body surfaces, ensuring realistic momentum exchange during collisions.

What is more, we will support more complex geometries for rigid bodies, and implement configuration options for different simulation scenarios.

Finally, we will fine-tune the rendering parameters to achieve more realistic water appearance, including material properties and lighting setup.
